Topic Primer: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/School-to-prison_pipeline

Topic: -School to prison pipeline = {high incarceration rate, low high school graduation rate, high juvenile delinquency rate, ''tendency of minors and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds to become incarcerated, because of increasingly harsh school and municipal policies."

Possible Questions: -School to Prison Pipelines: Do they Exist? Where? -What are significant contributors to School-to-Prison Pipelines? -What are the correlated effects of School to Prison pipelines? -How can School to Prison Pipelines be eliminated? -How can we predict where future prison-pipelines may occur?

Figure1: Include scatter plot of (x,y)= (time, High_Inc), overlaying Low_Inc=(Lowest Incarceration Rate State), Reg_Inc=(Regional Average), and (Fed_Inc) in different colors.

Looking to add the following contents:

-Budget_data by Best and Worst state (Lowest incarceration vs. Highest incarceration vs. Federal, Average), could classify obis of all states into H, M, and L if we miraculously got it for every state, but not looking to spend that long...)

--Municipal_Budget Predictor variables of interest: (Obtain using municipal budget data: income statement, Higher_Ed_funding/Total_Revenue, Secondary_Ed_funding/Total_Revenue, Early_Education_Funding/Total_Revenue

-Legislative_Policies (Google search: Best 2 Legislative Policies to fix school to prison pipeline, enter in a few as categorical variables, i.e. (death_penalty=0, 1) private prisons = (0,1) ,

-Department of Education Data by state: High School Graduation Rate by year, Juvenile delinquency rate,

Poverty Data by state: rate of homelessness, (To be uploaded by Erica soon)
-Health Data: See CDC website - https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/contents2017.htm?search=Functional_limitation, To be Continued...
